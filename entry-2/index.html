      <h3>Costumes:</h3>
      <p>
        The biggest difference between Halloween and any other time of the year is of course costumes!
  The perfect halloween party is one where people dress up and commit to the bit! You can motivate your guests to dress up
  by threatening to deny them entry if they don't (pro tip, hire a bouncer), or 
  you can play a little nicer and bribe them with a bottle of booze or a gift card via 
  a costume contest! Nothing like a little healthy competition to encourge people
  to dress their best.

      <h3>Food Options:</h3>
     <p>Pumpkin soup: My Aunt Stacy always has a big pot of this on the stove for her annual
  halloween party and it's a hit every time! Warm, festive and easily serves a crowd! Serve with crusty bread or
  roasted pumpkin seeds on top for an extra flair! </p>
<p>  Pumpkin Bread: Another Aunt Stacy staple this bread is baked in cans making it easy
  to cut into bit sized slices! I've tried a lot of pumpkin bread recipes and this one 
  has stayed on top!</p>
