      <h3>About me!</h3>
      <p>I'm Laney! A design student at Parsons. 
        I love bringing my friends together and creating bueatiful
     experiences! I live in New York City but was born and raised
    in Austin Texas, the live music capitol of the world. Everything I know about
    hospitality I learned from my family! I come from a lively house where friends and family
    were always welcome, coming and going.
    Me and my cousins grew up falling asleep to song circles in the living room at our parent's 
    legendary "pickin' parties", and holiday celebrations. As I got older my mom encourged me 
    to feel free to aleays bring home friends for dinner, and my dad taught me how to make 
    the dinner!
