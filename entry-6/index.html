      <h3>Make nice with your neighbors.</h3>
      <p>
        The easiest way to get your neighbors on board with a rager is to invite them.
        This isn’t always an option, but just be considerate, if you plan on having loud music and/or a
        lot of people over, write them a note or send over a text letting them know ahead of time. 
        If you want to go the extra mile include a plate of cookies!

      <h3>Some good bits</h3>
      <p>
        My friends and I have a tradition of playing the national anthem without warning late into our parties, 
        we make everyone stand up, put their hands to their hearts, and sing along. 
        The more inebriated your friends are at this point the funnier it is.
