  <h2>Parties you should throw! (and invite me to) </h2>

    <h3>1. Adult Spelling Bee 🐝</h3>
      <p>ignite everyone's competitive streak. If your friends are the kind of 
      people who still speak fondly of their high school english teachers they'll 
      love this</p>
    <p> <h3>2. Stone Soup Party🍲 </h3> </p>
      <p>Everyone brings an ingredient! It's like a potluck but everything goes into the 
      same pot. </p>
   <p> <h3>3. Make Up a Holiday!💭 </h3></p> 
      <p> Have you heard of the feast of the Leos? Of course you haven't! I made it up!
      You can celebrate by wearing firey colors, eating spicy foods, and presenting
      your best lion roar to the Lion King. Whoever's roar is determined to be the
      fiercest by the Lion King gets to be the new one. Please tell me about your fake 
      holiday.</p>
    <p> <h3>4. Exaggerate an existing holiday.📅 </h3> </p>
      <p> Don't have time to come up with your own whole holiday? I understand. We have a lot 
      of holidays already, go all out for a random one. Groundhog day traditions anyone? 
      Pi day party? </p>
    <p> <h3>5. Talent Show.🎤 </h3> </p>
      Invite your friends to show off! You just might be shocked by the amount of adults 
      in your life who know how to play the harmonica. 
    <p><h3>6. Tell all of your friends a different theme.🧚🏻‍♂️👰🏻‍♀️👙🎄 </p> </h3>      <p>Pool party? Black tie? Dress as your favorite rockstar? Put them all in one room! 
      Everyone will be thoroughly confused upon arrival. (according to my mom this is mean so be warned) </p>
